# ## Reception Events & Things
# 
# The tentative reception plan:
# 
# [**TODO**] Insert things for reception plan

# ## Decorations

# ### Live Band or Karoake Machine
# 
# We definitely wanted some music from a live band but if not, a karoake machine sounds good.
# 
# > We plan to have friends and family sign up to sing first, then open up the floor to guests. Jollin wants the bride and groom to sing a song together.

# ### Photo Booth
# Photo booth with on-site printing or on-site tags for online distribution would be cool. Consider something [like this](https://shutterbooth.com/atlanta/), which is a kiosk or photo booth with different cool gif, boomerang, etc.
# 
# It would be cool to make it ourselves so we can save money and reuse it, but if it fits in our budget, we can rent one.

# ## Invitations / Envelopes
# Vincent's dad mentioned going to Vietnam to print envelopes; however, if a trip to Vietnam is not available, we may need to order them online.
# 
# [**TODO**] Look up different prices for invitation printing.
